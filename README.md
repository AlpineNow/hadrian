=======

**Version v.0.6.2**

This repository contains two implementations of PFA (see http://scoringengine.org for details).

  * Hadrian: scoring engine for the JVM
  * Titus: scoring engine and toolkit for Python

It also contains four envelopes for embedding PFA.

  * hadrian-standalone: for running multithreaded Hadrian on a command line
  * hadrian-gae: for running Hadrian on Google App Engine
  * hadrian-hadoop: for running or training a model in Hadoop
  * hadrian-actors: an actor-based JVM process capable of complex, interacting scoring engine topologies

They are all licensed under the Hadrian Personal Use and Evaluation License (PUEL).
